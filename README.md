#Image Search Abstraction Layer 

This is the fourth api project for FreeCodeCamp.
Bing image api was our choice.

You can do two things with our api.

1)Search for images: http://imglr.herokuapp.com/search/insert your term here

This will get you the first 10 results from the bing api.
You can skip any number of results by providing and offset like this:
http://imglr.herokuapp.com/search/insert your term here?offset=insert your offset here

2)You can get a log of the 10 latest  search terms:
